    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "## Preparing the Data\n",
    "Before data can be used as input for machine learning algorithms, it often must be cleaned, formatted, and restructured — this is typically known as **preprocessing**. Fortunately, for this dataset, there are no invalid or missing entries we must deal with, however, there are some qualities about certain features that must be adjusted. This preprocessing can help tremendously with the outcome and predictive power of nearly all learning algorithms."

    "### Transforming Skewed Continuous Features\n",
    "A dataset may sometimes contain at least one feature whose values tend to lie near a single number, but will also have a non-trivial number of vastly larger or smaller values than that single number.  Algorithms can be sensitive to such distributions of values and can underperform if the range is not properly normalized. With the census dataset two features fit this description: '`capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`. \n",

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",

    "Run the code cell below to normalize each numerical feature. We will use [`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) for this."

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "Hand writing recognition can be deployed using SVM.\n",
    "Strengths of the model:\n",
    "\n",
    "Works well in high dimension spaces - for example, image recognition where every pixel may be treated as a feature. \n",
    "Maintains effectiveness even in cases where the number of dimensions exceeds the number of samples - again applicable in the field of image recognition. \n",
    "It is memory efficient due to its use of a subset of training points in the decision function. \n",
    "It provides versatility through the deployment of common and custom kernels. \n",
    "Works well in a complicated domain where there is a clear degree of seperation. \n",
    "Weaknesses of the model:\n",
    "\n",
    "Overfitting must be avoided through the selection of the correct kernel choice and regularisation term if the number of features far exceeds the number of samples.\n",
    "Inefficient five-fold cross-validation is deployed to calculate probability estimates. \n",
    "Can only be applied to two class tasks. As a result, multi-class tasks must be reduced to several binary problems.\n",
    "The parameters of a model that has been solved can be difficult to interpret.\n",
    "Does not perform well in large datasets as training is cubic in the size of the dataset. \n",
    "Does not work well with lots of noise, so when classes are overlapping you have to count independant evidence (this is where a NB classifier would work better). \n",
    "What makes it a good candidate for the problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "Sample size is greater than 50 samples (have enough data to train with).\n",
    "Data is labelled.\n",
    "Predicting a categorey (works with classification)\n",

    "SGD Classifier:\n",
    "\n",
    "One real world application:\n",

    "Strengths of the model:\n",
    "\n",
    "It is efficient. \n",
    "It is easy to implement and provides a lot of opportunities for code tuning. \n",
    "Weaknesses of the model:\n",
    "\n",
    "A number of hyperparameters are required for SGD, such as the number of iterations and the regularisation parameter. \n",

    "KNN can be used to provide recommendations. A real world example of this would be video streaming services such as Netflix or Amazon Prime. If a given user likes an item in the library, similar items that they may like, but are unaware of can be recommended to them by using data from other users and their likes. If it is seen that a similar set of users like two different items, these items are probably similar and to each the respective users taste, and worthy of a recommendation.\n",
    "Strengths of the model:\n",
    "\n",
    "Easy to understand and implement - not much code is required. \n",
    "No probability distributions are assumed based on the input data. This is useful with inputs where the probability distribution is unknown, making it robust. \n",
    "KNN is a lazy learner. This means it generalises data during the training phase, not the testing phase. This allows it quickly adapt to changes as it does not expect a generalised data set. \n",
    "Weaknesses of the model:\n",
    "\n",
    "KNN gets its information from its input neighbours. As a result of this, localised outliers can affect outcomes significantly when compared with other algorithms which have a generalised view of the data. It is sensitive to localised data. \n",
    "One of its strengths, lazy-learning, is also one of its weaknesses. As most of the computation is done during testing, rather than during training, this can result in long computation times when dealing with large datasets. \n",
    "If there is a type of categorey that is present much more than another, classifying an input will result in a bias to this more abundent categorey. This can be dealt with by adjusting the weights based on occurences, but will still pose a problem near the decision boundary. \n",
    "Inputs can be close to many points when there are many dimensions. The effectiveness of k-NN is reduced as a result. This is as it relies on the correlation between closeness and similarity. Dimension reduction can be used to reduce the effects of this, but variable trends may be lost as a result. \n",

    "F-Score: When 100% of the training set is used, the relative F-scores are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "SVC - 0.674\n",
    "SGD - 0.649\n",
    "KNeighborsClassifier - 0.639\n",
    "SCV provides the best results with respect to F-score, achieving 67.4%. SGD is second best, delivering 64.9%, a delta of 2.5%. However, as will be discussed in the next section, F-score alone is not all that should be taken into consideration, as the prediction and training time is also of importance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Prediction/Training Time: The model training time for SVC is by far and away the longest, at just over 140 seconds. Both SGD and Kneighbours are so small that they barely register on the bar chart. The model predicting time is greatest for KNeighbours, due to its lazy learner characteristics. SVC follows this, at just under 25 seconds. Once again, SGD trumps all by having, by a large margin, the shortest model prediction time. And for my work modifying parameters in the later exercise, this was crucial. I found that SVC would take far too long to complete with each additional parameter tuning. In comparison, SGD, was done almost instantly, and only with the aforementioned accuracy drop of 2.5% in comparison.\n",
    "\n",
    "Algorithm Suitability: Due to its relatively low time taken to train and predict, and relatively high f-score, I would suggest using the SGD model. If time was not an issue, and accuracy was a priority for the Charity, SVC could instead be deployed. As mentioned in the previous section, the alorithim is suitable as:\n",

    "education_level: Education level could be a predictor for the level of skilled or unskilled work someone could obtain. For example, someone with a college degree in computer science could work for a software company, earning a large salary whereas someone who has only obtained a high school degree may work in a less specialised and qualified role, earning less. However, there may also be cases where people are self educated, just like a software engineer, so it is not always a guarantee.\n",
    "\n",
    "occupation: Following up with education, the actual occupation will also be useful to determine salary - for example, did you graduate college with an arts degree and go on to work in mid-level employment, or did you graduate as a doctor, who works as a head surgeon in a hospital?\n",

    "hours-per-week: This is, for those either employed by the state or privately, simple mathematics. For the most part, those who work 40-50 hours a week should be recieving more than those working say, 10 hours a week. However, occupation is an important factor in this, as you may be working 50 hours a week at McDonalds, or 10 hours a week as an investment banker. This is why I have rated occupation higher.\n",

    "\n",
    "age: Lastly, I have included age, as I feel experience and an opportunity to climb the ladder of progression should show some correlation with a persons age. For example someone who is out of University 5 years, as oppose to someone who has been out of University 20 years should show a trend in real earnings comparitively."

    "Of the five features listed above (age, hours-per-week, capital-gain, marital-status, relationship), three of these were the same as mine (age, hour-per-week, capital-gain). This correlates with my understanding that with age, comes experience, and likely a large salary, that the hours-per-week you work is important (as most have contracted hours that reflects their individual salary) and that capital gain is a good indicator of percieved wealth.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, I was surprised to see both marital-status and relationship influence earnings so heavily. These features might be more relevant as it may reflect combined earnings, or that those who are succesful and earn more have the opportunity and money to be in a relationship."

    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "

    "**Answer:**\n",
    "The accuracy drop using the reduced feature set is good, seeing around a 6% drop in accuracy when compared with the full 13 feature set. I would be happy to use this lowered accuracy score if training time was a factor, as 78% is still a great result for removing over half the features (5 Vs 13).\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the F-score sees a substantially greater drop, falling by just over 20%. This is not acceptable for me, as we want an f-score as close to possible as 1. Previously, with the full 13 features and optimisation, we were achieving close to 70% on our f-score. With the reduced training set, we are not even getting 50%. One option would be to consider other models to see if they would provide a better tuned score with the reduced set that I previously listed as too slow (SVM) on the full feature set. If SVC could provide an f-score close to the 68% figure, with reduced training time, then I would consider using the reduced training set."
